9/Jan/2024 - After clone this repo into another pc. There have a problem to connect server. I found that it can't access to .env file. I will find solution and update soon. But website which deployed on hosting, is okay.

## SERVER SIDE

open #1 terminal

1. cd to backend folder
2. npm i
3. npm run dev
4. the result will show that you are listening to port 8000

<hr/>

## CLIENT SIDE

open #2 terminal while server side still running

1. cd to frontend folder
2. npm i
3. npm run dev
